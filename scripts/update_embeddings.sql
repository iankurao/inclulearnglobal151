-- This script is intended to be run after new data is inserted or existing data is updated
-- in tables that require vector embeddings.
-- It calls a Python script (generate_embeddings.py) to generate and update embeddings.

-- This is a conceptual script. In a real-world scenario, you would typically
-- trigger the Python script via a webhook, a background job, or a Supabase Edge Function
-- after data changes, rather than directly executing a Python script from SQL.

-- Example of how you might conceptually trigger an update (not directly executable SQL):
-- SELECT http_post('your_edge_function_url/generate-embeddings', '{"table": "health_specialists", "column": "description"}');

-- For manual execution or integration with a CI/CD pipeline, you would run the Python script directly:
-- python scripts/generate_embeddings.py

-- The actual SQL part would be for creating the `match_documents` function if it's not already there,
-- or for any other database-side operations related to embeddings.
-- (The `match_documents` function is provided in `supabase/migrations/20250801000000_add_vector_support.sql`)

-- No direct SQL commands to execute the Python script here.
-- This file serves as a reminder/documentation for the embedding update process.
