-- This script is intended to be run manually or via a CI/CD pipeline
-- after new data is added or existing data is updated in the tables.
-- It calls the `generate_embedding` function (which would be a Supabase Edge Function
-- or a custom function that interfaces with an embedding model)
-- and updates the `embedding` column for relevant rows.

-- Example for health_specialists table:
UPDATE public.health_specialists
SET embedding = generate_embedding(description)
WHERE description IS NOT NULL AND embedding IS NULL;

-- Example for schools table:
UPDATE public.schools
SET embedding = generate_embedding(description)
WHERE description IS NOT NULL AND embedding IS NULL;

-- Example for outdoor_clubs table:
UPDATE public.outdoor_clubs
SET embedding = generate_embedding(description)
WHERE description IS NOT NULL AND embedding IS NULL;

-- You might want to add more sophisticated logic here,
-- e.g., only update if description has changed, or process in batches.
